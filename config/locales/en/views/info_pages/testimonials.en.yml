          testimonial_1:
            person: Jagoda Bracha
            role: Participant
            content: "For me the best in MBL was: making new friends and the pervasive atmosphere of socializing with other people and friendliness, opportunity to talk to people from abroad and practice English, variety of non-mathematical activities and good quality of not only olympic (what is a big problem at most of camps) mathematical classes. I was trying to use my time on the camp maximally, so I didn't have any time to just sit in my room. Also is the only camp I have been where organizers and participants are equal, nobody is forced to do something (for example attend classes or go to sleep)."

            role: Participant
            content: As a first non-school math camp it was a great experience for me. I was amazed by level of lectures, participants and the English of participants. I also have never been to a camp that is only directed by young people. And here big shoutout to crew that managed to keep us in peaceful climate.

            role: Participant
            content:  Maths Beyond Limits is the best mathematical camp I've ever been to. It is so great because of so many friendly people that make this  wonderful atmosphere here.

            person: Pavel Hudec
            role: Participant
            content: Some might think of MBL as a way to improve their mathematical skills. Some might take it as an opportunity to meet friendly, open-minded people and build several long-lasting friendships. However, if you combine these two approaches, it will emerge as an amazing experience when you look back. And that's exactly what it is all about.
